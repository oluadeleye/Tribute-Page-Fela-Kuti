        <li>1938: Born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15 in Abeokuta, Nigeria.</li>
        <li>1963: Kuti formed a band called Koola Lobitos. He would later change the band's name to Afrika 70, and again to Egypt 80.</li>
        <LI>1967: He went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his music Afrobeat.</LI>
        <LI>1969: In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles. While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party.</LI>
        <LI>1977: Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military.</LI>
        <LI>1978: Fela married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers. The marriage served not only to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to protect Fela, and his wives, from false claims from authorities that Fela was kidnapping the women.</LI>
